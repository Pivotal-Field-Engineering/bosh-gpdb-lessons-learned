# bosh-gpdb-lessons-learned

This is my attempt to preserve what I learned in my attempt to get the GPDB BOSH release
working, including getting the Director running.

## Quick Overview
- It was not easy or intuitive for me
- It did, eventually, work, and I was able to use this in a demo in Reston, VA on June 9, 2016
- The above would not have been possible without the helpful assistance of Todd Ritchie, via
  the #big-data-services Slack channel
- I am a huge fan, believe in the cloud agnosticism BOSH can provide

## Resources
1. The _IaaS Account & Consolidated Bill Request_ form (NEED LINK) got me started with an AWS account
2. The [GPDB BOSH release code](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bds-ci/gpdb-bosh-release/greenplum-0.11.4-artifacts.tgz)
